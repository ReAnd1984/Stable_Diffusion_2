# Stable Diffusion 2

Stable Diffusion 2 is a powerful deep learning architecture for image generation and manipulation. This repository contains the implementation of Stable Diffusion 2 in Python using TensorFlow/Keras.

## Overview
Stable Diffusion 2 is an extension of the original Stable Diffusion model, designed to improve image generation quality and efficiency. It utilizes diffusion processes in latent spaces to generate high-quality images from textual descriptions or other input modalities.

## Features
- Image generation from textual descriptions.
- Image inpainting (filling in missing parts of images).
- Transition between two latent vectors corresponding to different texts.
- GIF animation creation.
- Mixed-Precision support for improved training speed (can be disabled for certain processes).
